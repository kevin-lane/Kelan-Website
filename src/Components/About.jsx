                <h3> Office365/SharePoint Developer - Enfo  (Oct. 2019 - Feb. 2020) </h3>
                <p>At Enfo I worked in the Modern Workplace Team mainly 
                    developing applications for SharePoint with SharePoint Framework using mainly JavaScript, TypeScript and React. 
                    While working here I also learnt about Microsoft Power Platform where I even got a chance to make a configuration in MS Flow for one of Enfos clients.
                    Since we worked with an agile approach with Scrum using Azure DevOps and Daily meetings I have found an interest in this approach. I also got to learn 
                    the basics of Azure.</p>
